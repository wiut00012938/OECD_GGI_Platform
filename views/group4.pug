                  | Uzbekistan has been facing increasing air pollution and had 909 thousand tonnes of pollutants in the air in 2021. 
                | Over half of the Uzbekistan population is daily exposed to particulate matters (PM2.5) concentrations above 35µg/m3.  
              li 
                b In 2021, Tashkent city had the 10th worst air quality of any city globally in terms of average annual PM2.5 concentrations, while Uzbekistan was ranked 12th worst. 
                |  Uzbekistan was the second most polluted Central Asian country in 2019, next to Tajikistan.

                |  Over 750 people die in 1 million inhabitants annually in Uzbekistan due to exposure to PM2.5. Almost 10% of deaths in Uzbekistan in 2022 were caused by respiratory diseases. 
                b  Premature death and other health problems due to exposure to PM cost 8.7% of GDP equivalent annually.
              li 
                b By 2021, only 68% of Uzbekistan households had access to safe drinking water. The proportion declined from 82.5% in 2010. 
                |  Uzbekistan's outdated water supply infrastructure has stagnated or declined water services. Access to safe drinking water is worse in rural areas.
