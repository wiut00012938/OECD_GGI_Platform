                  | Uzbekistan has been facing increasing air pollution and had 909 thousand tonnes of pollutants in the air in 2021. 
                | Over half of the Uzbekistan population is daily exposed to particulate matters (PM2.5) concentrations above 35µg/m3.  
              li 
                b In 2021, Tashkent city had the 10th worst air quality of any city globally in terms of average annual PM2.5 concentrations, while Uzbekistan was ranked 12th worst. 
                |  Uzbekistan was the second most polluted Central Asian country in 2019, next to Tajikistan.

                |  Over 750 people die in 1 million inhabitants annually in Uzbekistan due to exposure to PM2.5. Almost 10% of deaths in Uzbekistan in 2022 were caused by respiratory diseases. 
                b  Premature death and other health problems due to exposure to PM cost 8.7% of GDP equivalent annually.

                |  Uzbekistan's outdated water supply infrastructure has stagnated or declined water services. Access to safe drinking water is worse in rural areas.

          i Air pollution is increasing in Uzbekistan, making it one of the “most air polluted countries in the world”
          ul
            li
              | Air pollution, in terms of the volume of pollutants emitted in the atmosphere, has spiked since 2010. The major components of pollutants are sulphates, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust and water. The concentration of fine particulate matter of 2.5 micrometres in dimension (PM2.5) in the air is generally high. Over the past decade, it exceeded the 35 microgrammes per cubic metre (µg/m3) level considered unhealthy by the World Health Organization (WHO)
            li Most air pollution issues in the country are attributed to the Aral Sea desertification and dust storms carrying iron oxide and other toxic PM. Meanwhile, pollution in Tashkent City is primarily due to vehicle use, which constituted around 60% of the source in 2021. 
          i Over half of the Uzbekistan population has been exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution since 2010
          ul 
            li
              | The share of the population exposed to unhealthy concentration levels of PM2.5 declined from around 80% to 56% over the past ten years. However, more than half of the Uzbekistan population has been exposed daily to unhealthy PM2.5 concentrations of above 35µg/m3 since 2010. This population exposure level is more than five times higher than the world average of 10%.
          i Mortality due to air pollution and the cost of premature death is high and increasing above the world average
          i Mortality and welfare costs due to exposure to ozone and lead gases decreased

          i The share of households with access to safe drinking water supply has fallen since 2015, and access is still a challenge in rural areas.
          ul
            li
              | The share of households’ access to drinking water from an improved and safe source on-premises, when needed, declined by 10% over the past ten years. In 2022, 72% of Uzbekistan households had access to safe drinking water, a decline from 82.5% in 2010. The proportion declined and stagnated mainly due to outdated water supply infrastructure and water services despite increased population and housing. The proportion is less than the world average, and there is high inequality between cities and rural areas. While over 97% of houses in Tashkent City have access to drinking water, the Kashkadarya region has the lowest access rate.
          i The share of households with access to a sewerage system has grown in the last three years
          ul 
            li
              | Uzbekistan made some progress in expanding public sewerage systems moderately and steadily since 2020. Nevertheless, in 2022 less than half (48%) of households are connected to a sewerage system with inequality between cities and regions. For instance, all households in Tashkent City are connected to a sewerage treatment system. However, in Karakalpakstan, only 16% of households are connected (Table 5.1). The World Bank (2022) indicates that most households in rural areas only have self-built onsite sanitation-dry pit latrines or septic tanks with onsite disposal. Moreover, collected wastewater is not treated according to international standards.
          i Uzbekistan has achieved 100% population access to improved sanitation
          ul 
            li All of Uzbekistan’s population had access to improved sanitation as early as 2014, showing progress from 93% in 2000. Thus, the country has achieved the 2030 SDG towards goal six of universal access to sanitation.
