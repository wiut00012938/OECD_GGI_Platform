        | This group of indicators explores how progress towards green growth is generating economic opportunities in Moldova. The indicators measure innovation in the green economy/environment, public and private expenditures for environmental 
        |  protection, and subsidies for energy and organic agriculture. In so doing, they capture the economic opportunities associated with green growth, assessing the effectiveness of policy in areas such as technology and innovation, environmental goods and services, investment and financing, prices, taxes and transfers.

                  | Share of environment- related innovations in Uzbekistan is growing. 
                |  Over 15% of the innovations in Uzbekistan in 2018 were environment related; this was 0.02 technologies per capita.
              li 
                b Public expenditures in environmental protection (including SDG 13, Climate Change) are relatively low, but growing. 
                |  On average, environmental expenditure accounted for 0.06% of total government expenditures in 2012–2019. The proportion of environmental protection expenditures relative to GDP was 0.02% In 2019.

                b Increase in economic activity led to increase in environmental revenues  in Uzbekistan. 
                |  The aggregate annual volume of tax revenues from pollutant pays averaged about 0.01% of the state budget for 2015-2018, mostly from solid waste management. 
                b Uzbekistan however does not yet systematically track all ‘green’ revenues from taxes, charges, and fees; thus, the amount of environmental revenue is underestimated.
              li 
                b Uzbekistan’s energy sector aims to phase out the fossil fuel subsidies gradually.
                |  In 2020, Uzbekistan’s subsidies for fossil fuels amounted to 6.6% of the GDP and were reduced by 60% of the 2010 level.  Over half of the fossil fuel subsidy goes to the natural gas sector.

                b Price for energy is growing 
                |  to reach its market value. Until 2017 there was a single tariff in Uzbekistan for all consumer categories, then Uzbekistan set different tariffs for different categories of consumers. The tariff for commercial consumers was 30% to 50% more than residential use tariffs. 
                b Price for water is also growing.
                |  The tariffs vary by region and have been revised several times. Though water tariff levels and collection rates have increased, it does not cover operational costs.
              li 
                b International financial flows in support of Uzbekistan’s green growth strategy are evolving. 
                |  In 2023, loans and grants for green investments is USD 840 mln and USD 66 mln, respectively.
